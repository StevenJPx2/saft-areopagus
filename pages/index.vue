          <h3>What is The Areopagus Project?</h3>
          <p>
            The Areopagus Project is the brand new initiative of SAFT
            Apologetics. While SAFT Podcast is our podcast wing, 'The Areopagus
            Project' is our conference wing.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>What was the name of this year's conference?</h3>
          <p>The name of this year's conference was Areopagus 2021.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Was this the first conference of SAFT?</h3>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Why the name Areopagus?</h3>
          <p>
            Areopagus is the name of the hill upon which Paul delivered his
            speech recorded in Acts 17. The passage of Acts 17 displays
            evangelism and apologetics in sync as Paul invites those who seek
            God to be assured of His nearness. This is very much the heart of
            what we do: inviting all to seek answers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>
            Is The Areopagus Project related to 'The Areopagus' podcast, 'The
            Areopagus Project blog' or 'LCF Areopagus Project'?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Neither SAFT Apologetics nor The Areopagus Project is affiliated in
            any way with any of the above mentioned initiatives. While selecting
            the name our preliminary search via ministry associates and the
            internet didn't bring up these initiatives. It was well into the
            planning of the event that Jacob stumbled upon these similar named
            initiatives.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Can we expect Areopagus 2022?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! We are very much looking forward to the next year. As of now we
            don't have any plans to call off the conference but since our aim is
            to 'use' the conference to 'share the Gospel effectively' and not do
            a conference just for namesake, if we come upon another avenue we
            can focus our efforts on, we may have to consider it. After all, as
            our Creative Director Steven says, we are a 'microscopic team' so
            there's only so much we can do!
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Who can join the final day of the conference?</h3>
          <p>
            The final day is an exclusive-invitation-only event. Invitation is
            sent out from SAFT Apologetics to selected individuals and
            ministries.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>How can I support the event?</h3>
          <p>
            You can support the event by keeping the team and the event in your
            prayers and sharing the poster and news about the conference to
